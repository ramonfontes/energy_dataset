# About

This repository contains a dataset collected from my own home.

## Electrical Parameters:

Records the electric current (in Amperes) flowing through the Phases over time.

- **phase_a_current.csv**: Contains current measurements for Phase A.
- **phase_b_current.csv**: Contains current measurements for Phase B.
- **phase_c_current.csv**: Contains current measurements for Phase C.

Contains voltage readings (in Volts) for the Phases.

- **phase_a_voltage.csv**: Voltage values for Phase A over time.
- **phase_b_voltage.csv**: Voltage values for Phase B over time.
- **phase_c_voltage.csv**: Voltage values for Phase C over time.


Records active power output (in Watts) from the sources.

- **output_power_active_1.csv**: Active power output (in Watts) from source/output 1.
- **output_power_active_2.csv**: Active power output (in Watts) from source/output 2.

Tracks energy consumed on the Phases.

- **phase_a_energy_consumption.csv**: Energy consumed on Phase A.
- **phase_b_energy_consumption.csv**: Energy consumed on Phase B.
- **phase_c_energy_consumption.csv**: Energy consumed on Phase C.


## Environmental Sensors:

Logs temperature readings from the radiators.

- **radiator_1_temperature.csv**: Logs temperature readings (in °C) from radiator 1.
- **radiator_2_temperature.csv**: Logs temperature readings (in °C) from radiator 2.

Measures solar irradiance (W/m²).

- **irradiance.csv**

Logs general ambient temperature data, recorded by a sensor located outdoors.

- **temperature.csv**
